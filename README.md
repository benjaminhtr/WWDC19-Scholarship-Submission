About this playground 🧒
---

This idea behind this playground is to make it easier for children to learn writing numbers with the help of technology. I use CoreML/Vision and MNIST to support students in the learning process and to explore and demonstrate new and modern ways of teaching.

I want to combine current technologies from our time with the best learning experience to get more young people excited about technology and provide them with an easy-to-use experience that allows them to study seamlessly.

<b>But why?</b>

Some children in elementary school have deep problems with math. Affected children can’t combine logic with the visual representation of numbers, which is why they continuosly make mistakes, even though they might have gotten it right once before.

They often have problems realizing the relationships between different numbers and how they are associated with each other. Neither do they have an idea or feeling for how high a number might be. Because this is a clear problem in our society, I decided to counter this and develop this playground.

Get ready to run the code 🏃‍♂️
